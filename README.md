# Hi, I'm Malloy 👋

A learner who loves building websites — and everything about **Minecraft**.

I've been into **web development** for about one year, and I'm still learning and making steady progress every day.

I enjoy exploring **frontend frameworks**, creating small projects, and bringing ideas to life through code.

Outside of coding, I make **Minecraft renders** as a way to express what I feel inside — night dreams, quiet emotions, and sudden sparks of inspiration.

Also a passionate manga lover — I find comfort and inspiration in stories that blend imagination, emotion, and quiet beauty.
